# 100 Days Of Logic

This repository documents my journey of solving one analytical problem every day for 100 days. Each day, I’ll tackle a new challenge, write clean and efficient code, and upload the solution here.  

The goal of this project is to:  
- Strengthen problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.  
- Build consistency by coding daily.  
- Create a public portfolio of analytical solutions.  
- Encourage others to join the challenge and practice together.  

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (primary), with occasional use of other languages for variety.  
- **Tools:** GitHub for version control, Jupyter/VS Code for development.  
- **Approach:** Each problem will include a clear explanation, code solution, and where possible, optimized approaches.
